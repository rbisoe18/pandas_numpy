checks\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the main branch of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reproducible Example\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndef test_reproduction():\\r\\n    unfiltered = DataFrame(\\r\\n        {\\r\\n            \"planned_date\": {\\r\\n                \"0\": date.fromisoformat(\"2020-10-01\"),\\r\\n                \"1\": date.fromisoformat(\"2020-08-01\"),\\r\\n            },\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    )\\r\\n    filtered = unfiltered.query(f\\'planned_date >= datetime.strptime(\"2020-09-01\", \"%Y-%m-%d\").date()\\')\\\\\\r\\n        .copy().reset_index(drop=True)\\r\\n    assert (\\r\\n        filtered.to_json()\\r\\n        == unfiltered.iloc[[0]].reset_index(drop=True).to_json()\\r\\n    )\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis results in the following exception, whereas on versions before 1.5.0 it works\\r\\n```\\r\\n            except KeyError as err:\\r\\n>               raise UndefinedVariableError(key, is_local) from err\\r\\nE               pandas.errors.UndefinedVariableError: name \\'datetime\\' is not defined\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Issue Description\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behavior change in #47273 appears to make it to where I cannot use the `datetime` global in a query string being passed to eval. I\\'m also just not sure what the right way is to now access globals within an eval, is there a better way to write this query?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nTest passes\\r\\n\\r\\n###

#50400 with @lithomas1 . Doesn't directly solve this, but a lot of our util.pyx functions are in essence C functions to begin with. Because they are implemented in Cython though, its a built difficult to use them in our non-Cython extensions like JSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis takes the code out of the Cython file and ports to a C header file. This is mostly a verbatim copy with some special considerations done for NA handling. Marking as draft because I'm not sure a header-only solution is better than a shared library, but need more time to mess around with the setup script. May also just wait until we implement meson fully\",\n","  'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/50425/reactions',\n","   'total_count': 0,\n","   '+1': 0,\n","
